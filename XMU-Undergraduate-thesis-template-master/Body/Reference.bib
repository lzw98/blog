  year={2015},
 abstract={随着我国市场经济的不断完善，许多上市公司在享受市场经济环境带来的无限的发展机遇的同时，也受到各种潜在风险的威胁，随时都可能因财务风险而被贴上ST的标签甚至最终走向退市的危险。为了能提前防范这种风险的发生，有必要对财务风险进行预测，及时了解企业的财务状况，并对企业潜在的导致财务风险发生的因素，进行及时规避。这对于企业长期稳定的发展具有十分重要的意义。 本文对上市公司财务风险预测指标体系和模型进行了研究。首先，介绍了研究涉及到的基本概念和理论，其中包括财务风险的界定和数据挖掘理论；其次，对构建上市公司财务风险预测指标体系所遵循了基本原则、指标分析、指标计算和适用性检验进行详细的阐述。再次，对财务风险预测模型的构建流程进行了介绍，并重点分析了主成分分析法和CART算法在整个预测模型的构建过程中运用。最后，以75家上市公司为例，构建了上市公司财务风险预测模型，进行了实证分析，并通过与常见智能算法进行对比研究，验证了模型的高效性。},

Based on data from the optimistic period of 1999, this research demonstrates that traditional ﬁnancial ratios concerning relative proﬁtability, capital structure, and the power to ﬁnance growth internally almost completely explain which ﬁrms would fail within 2 years. Flawed business plans and poor execution are root causes. Measures of working capital correlate signiﬁcantly and opposite to the direction typically found in the literature. Additionally, ﬁrms that rely heavily on uncertain legal and regulatory outcomes are signiﬁcantly more likely to go bankrupt.},

Our analysis focuses on the abnormal turnover of these directors during the fraud committing period, before fraud is discovered and before lawsuits are filed. Our empirical analysis shows that, during the fraud committing period, outside directors in fraud firms exhibit an abnormal level of turnover. Examining the characteristics of outside directors and boards at these fraud firms, we find strong evidence that female directors, directors who have greater stock ownership in the firm, and directors with multiple directorships at other firms are more likely to depart fraud firms. We also find some evidence that board size, number of meetings, and fraction of financial experts are related to abnormal turnover in fraud firms during the fraud committing period. We show that abnormal director turnover is significantly higher for fraud that is considered more egregious (i.e., involving fictitious transactions and disclosure problems). Lastly, directors are more likely to depart fraud firms with more serious fraud, as proxied by higher ex-post settlement amounts and longer fraud duration.},

	abstract = {Ratio type ﬁnancial indicators are the most popular explanatory variables in bankruptcy prediction models. These measures often exhibit heavily skewed distribution because of the presence of outliers. In the absence of clear deﬁnition of outliers, ad hoc approaches can be found in the literature for identifying and handling extreme values. However, it is not clear how these diﬀerent approaches can aﬀect the predictive power of models. There seems to be consensus in the literature on the necessity of handling outliers, at the same time, it is not clear how to deﬁne extreme values to be handled in order to maximize the predictive power of models. There are two possible ways to reduce the bias originating from outliers: omission and winsorization. Since the ﬁrst approach has been examined previously in the literature, we turn our attention to the latter. We applied the most popular classiﬁcation methodologies in this ﬁeld: discriminant analysis, logistic regression, decision trees ({CHAID} and {CART}) and neural networks (multilayer perceptron). We assessed the predictive power of models in the framework of tenfold stratiﬁed crossvalidation and area under the {ROC} curve. We analyzed the eﬀect of winsorization at 1, 3 and 5\% and at 2 and 3 standard deviations, furthermore we discretized the range of each variable by the {CHAID} method and used the ordinal measures so obtained instead of the original ﬁnancial ratios. We found that this latter data preprocessing approach is the most eﬀective in the case of our dataset. In order to check the robustness of our results, we carried out the same empirical research on the publicly available Polish bankruptcy dataset from the {UCI} Machine Learning Repository. We obtained very similar results on both datasets, which indicates that the {CHAID}-based categorization of ﬁnancial ratios is an eﬀective way of handling outliers with respect to the predictive performance of bankruptcy prediction models.},

Additional experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the meta-learning framework over state-of-the-art financial fraud detection methods. Moreover, the {MetaFraud} framework generates confidence scores associated with each prediction that can facilitate unprecedented financial fraud detection performance and serve as a useful decision-making aid.
