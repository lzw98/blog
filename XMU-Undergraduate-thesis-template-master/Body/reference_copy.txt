 abstract={如何准确预测上市公司财务危机是一个有重要实际意义的问题，但也是一个困难的问题，原因在于：预测的准确性不但取决于统计模型的好坏，而且与变量的选择也有密切关系。本文从变量选择出发，基于两个常用模型——广义线性模型和广义线性混合模型来构建上市公司财务预警模型，研究模型选择与变量选择对财务预测的影响。 本文选取120家制造业上市公司2006-2012年的相关财务数据，构建了原始指标集，初步分析发现这些指标之间存在较强的相关性。本文研究的因变量是上市公司是否被ST，它是一个0-1变量服从伯努利分布是二项分布的一种特殊形式，本文采用广义线性模型进行拟合。因此，本文建立广义线性模型采用逐步回归、LASSO和SCAD方法进行变量选择。依据选择的变量构建了3个广义线性模型，通过比较模型选取变量的个数、变量的经济意义、模型的拟合效果以及模型的预测效果，我们认为SCAD变量选择方法得到的模型最为理想，LASSO方法和逐步回归方法的效果较差。其中LASSO方法对于ST公司的预测效果是三者中最差的；逐步回归方法选取的变量中有2个变量的经济意义与现有的财务理论不符。 接下来，本文根据上述3种方法选取的变量分别构建广义线型混合模型。我们知道，通常情况下不同行业的上市公司平均来看面临的财务风险不同，基于这样的考虑本文引入新财富行业分类标准，结合上述3种方法选取的变量构建了3个广义线性混合模型。结果显示3个模型的整体效果非常的接近，SCAD方法得到的模型要稍好些。本文通过比较广义线性混合模型与广义线性模型发现进行财务预测研究时，广义线型混合模型具有如下几方面的优势：（1）模型的随机效应部分符合目前行业的发展特点，可以很好的解释现实的各个行业状况；（2）模型更加简洁，广义线性混合模型的固定效应部分包含的变量个数明显的小于广义线性模型。（3）广义线性混合模型的预测精度相比广义线性模型都有所提高。此外，进一步对广义线性混合模型与数据挖掘方法进行比较，发现广义线性混合模型也优于数据挖掘的方法，具体表现在简洁性和实用性上。 本文的研究表明，进行财务危机预测时，变量选择的好坏直接关系到模型的预测精度。SCAD变量选择方法得到的广义线性模型明显的优于LASSO和逐步回归方法得到的模型。此外，统计模型的好坏也直接影响到财务预测的准确性，相比广义线性模型，广义线型混合模型的预测精度都有一定程度的提高，并且模型更加精简、更加符合经济意义。},

 abstract={金融市场的风险无处不在,上市公司的运营受到方方面面因素的影响,因此对于上市公司财务风险的研究也有着重大的意义。传统的基于财务报表的研究方法例如五因子的Z-score模型等在财务风险预测领域有着重大意义,但仍有其局限性。一方面,传统的统计分析模型大多只采用了较少的财务指标。此外,对于文本信息传统模型大多没有能力进行分析。而随着大数据时代的到来,以上两方面的限制可以部分上得到解决。近年来随着计算机技术的不断发展,Fintech逐渐成为了金融领域的主要研究方向之一。机器学习,人工智能,深度神经网络逐渐被更多人认知和了解,其在图像识别,自动驾驶,自然语言处理等方面都给人们留下了深刻的印象,证明它存在着无限的潜力。深度学习的强大之处就在于它具有复杂的模型结构以及大量的参数,我们能以此对海量的历史数据进行充分的挖掘和学习。而金融领域就是一个充满数据的环境,出现财务风险的公司往往在危机爆发前就可以从其财务状况,运营状况,社会舆论等种种信息中找到线索。因此,如何构建一套基于机器学习的上市公司财务风险识别系统,对于大量的数据进行有效的挖掘和利用,从而实现对于上市公司的高效监管是—个值得深入研究的问题。本文对于上市公司的报表数据以及年报文本数据分别加以利用。对于上市公司的财务报表数据我们利用决策树,随机森林以及XGBoost模型进行挖掘并对比其分类效果。对于上市公司年报文本数据,本文经过清洗以后利用预训练词向量将文本数值化,构建基于深度神经网络的分类模型,并使用改进的损失函数对模型进行优化。最终将两个模型的结果进行综合,得到该公司存在财务风险概率的最终预测值。我们的实证结果显示随机森林以及XGBoost的综合模型均获得了较好的分类效果,而文本信息的加入也能够略微提高模型的分类效能。其中,XGBoost模型达到了最高的综合评分,而随机森林模型虽然综合评分略低于XGBoost,但取得了 82.53%的召回率,即在测试集中所有存在财务风险的公司有82.53%的公司均被模型成功识别。由于在金融市场中漏判一家存在风险的公司所带来的损失远超过将正常的公司误判,因此在这种情境下召回率比准确率更加重要,因此本文认为结果最优的模型是基于随机森林的模型。},

 abstract={十余年来，我国证券市场财务报告舞弊层出不穷、丑闻迭起。不仅给投资者带来重大损失，而且破坏了证券市场赖以存在和发展的“公平”、“公正”和“公开”原则，动摇并挫伤了投资者的信心。 与之相应，学术界对财务报告舞弊也展开了积极不懈的研究，取得一定的成果。通过检索相关文献，我们发现，以往的研究侧重于规范研究和案例分析，而经验分析较少。而且，至少有以下四个问题，人们尚未取得较为一致的结论。它们是：(1) 可否发展一种新的理论来解释财务报告舞弊的形成机理?(2) 我国财务报告舞弊的影响因素有哪些?财务报告舞弊公司的财务变量和治理变量有何特征?(3) 目前的治理措施有效吗?独立董事是否提高了会计政策的稳健性，进而降低财务报告舞弊发生的机会?(4) 如何比较有效地治理财务报告舞弊?可否“毕其功于一役”? 为了寻求以上诸问题的答案，本文采用规范研究与实证分析相结合的方法。主要是运用认识论、博弈论和归纳法推演出财务报告舞弊的四因子假说(文化、动机、机会和权衡等四个因子)，再采用均值T检验、多元回归分析等方法考察财务报告舞弊的影响因素，并检验独立董事制度是否减少了财务报告舞弊的机会。 论文共分为六章。第1章 楔子。主要介绍研究背景与动机、研究方法、研究假设、研究流程和内容安排。第2章 文献探讨。按照“国别—研究主题”的方法来梳理以往的知识存量，意欲了解前人有哪些重要的发现，还有哪些未竟领域和可以拓展的研究机会。第3章 财务报告舞弊的形成机理：四因子假说。首先介绍西方国家四种主流舞弊理论，并从思想文化、动机、机会和经济利益权衡等角度分析财务报告舞弊的成因。在此基础上，提出财务报告舞弊的四因子假说，认为当文化、动机、机会和权衡四个影响因子皆备时，财务报告舞弊就会发生。第4章 财务报告舞弊的影响因素：动 机与机会的检验。由于文化因子和权衡因子存在定量上和数据可获得性上 的困难，本章主要检验动机因子和机会因子对舞弊的影响。即考察财务报 告舞弊公司财务变量与公司治理变量的特征。第5章财务报告舞弊的治理 效率:来自独立董事的证据。主要运用截面Jones及其修正模型、T检验、 M~一whitney检验、’Pearson和Speannan相关性检验和OLs等方法检验 独立董事是否提高会计政策的稳健性，进而降低财务报告舞弊的机会。第6 章研究结论与政策建议。指出本研究的学术贡献、局限性和未来的拓展机 会。在此基础上，提出四点实用性的政策建议:(l)筑就反舞弊的四道防 线，对舞弊形成层层包围之势;(2)提高舞弊的成本;(3)加强监管;(4) 注重反舞弊的国际合作。 论文的创新主要有以下四点:(l)提出财务报告舞弊的四因子假说， 认为在文化、动机、机会和权衡四个因子皆备时，财务报告舞弊就会发生; (2)T检验和Logistic回归分析发现，财务压力大的企业具备强烈的舞弊 动机，而治理失败则会提高舞弊发生的机会;(3)单变量分析发现，与未 设立独立董事的公司相比，设立独立董事公司的可操控应计利润较低;多 变量分析(OLS)显示，可操控应计利润与独立董事的比例呈U型曲线关系; (4)以前年度因舞弊财务报告而被监管部门处罚后，其会计政策趋于稳健。 经验证据在一定程度上验证了舞弊的四因子假说。 同时，论文至少还存在以下局限性:(l)在分析舞弊影响因素时，样 本量比较小;(2)未被发现的舞弊和审计中发现的舞弊未纳入研究样本; (3)截面fones及其修正模型并不一定都适合我国。 未来的拓展机会可能有:(l)文字性财务报告舞弊问题:(2)非正式 制度安排对财务报告舞弊的影响;(3)财务报告舞弊的典型案例分析:(4) 中外财务报告舞弊比较研究;(5)财务报告舞弊的实证研究等。而这些后 续研究必将改进财务报告的质量，为新兴的中国证券市场注入活力。},

At the same time, the resurgence of Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) has led to the investigation of machine learning techniques and their applicability in supply chain risk management. However, most works focus on prediction performance and neglect the importance of interpretability so that results can be understood by supply chain practitioners, helping them make decisions that can mitigate or prevent risks from occurring. In this work, we first propose a supply chain risk prediction framework using data-driven {AI} techniques and relying on the synergy between {AI} and supply chain experts. We then explore the trade-off between prediction performance and interpretability by implementing and applying the framework on the case of predicting delivery delays in a real-world multi-tier manufacturing supply chain. Experiment results show that prioritising interpretability over performance may require a level of compromise, especially with regard to average precision scores.},

For the test of the model we considered a real setting of Spanish enterprises from the construction sector. With this procedure we intend to overcome the sampling-bias problems that matched-pairs models often suffer. We estimated two benchmark models: a back propagation neural network and a simple {MARS} model.

	abstract = {Bankruptcy prediction is one of the most important issues in ﬁnancial decision-making. Constructing effective corporate bankruptcy prediction models in time is essential to make companies or banks prevent bankruptcy. This study proposes a novel bankruptcy prediction model based on an adaptive fuzzy k-nearest neighbor ({FKNN}) method, where the neighborhood size k and the fuzzy strength parameter m are adaptively speciﬁed by the continuous particle swarm optimization ({PSO}) approach. In addition to performing the parameter optimization for {FKNN}, {PSO} is also utilized to choose the most discriminative subset of features for prediction. Adaptive control parameters including time-varying acceleration coefﬁcients ({TVAC}) and time-varying inertia weight ({TVIW}) are employed to efﬁciently control the local and global search ability of {PSO} algorithm. Moreover, both the continuous and binary {PSO} are implemented in parallel on a multi-core platform. The proposed bankruptcy prediction model, named {PTVPSO}-{FKNN}, is compared with ﬁve other state-of-the-art classiﬁers on two real-life cases. The obtained results clearly conﬁrm the superiority of the proposed model in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy, Type I error, Type {II} error and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) criterion. The proposed model also demonstrates its ability to identify the most discriminative ﬁnancial ratios. Additionally, the proposed model has reduced a large amount of computational time owing to its parallel implementation. Promisingly, {PTVPSO}-{FKNN} might serve as a new candidate of powerful early warning systems for bankruptcy prediction with excellent performance.},

	abstract = {Reported dollar losses from online auction fraud were over \$43M in 2008 in the {US} ({NW}3C, 2009). In general, reputation systems provided by online auction sites are the most common countermeasure available for buyers to evaluate a seller’s credit. Unfortunately, feedback score mechanisms are too easily manipulated, creating falsely overrated reputations. In addition, existing research on online auction fraud shows that a more complicated reputation management system could weaken the motivation of committing a fraud. However, very few of the previous work addresses the most important issue of a fraud detection mechanism is to discover a fraudster before he defrauds as early as possible. Therefore, developing an effective early fraud detection mechanism is necessary to prevent fraud for online auction participants.},

This study aims at developing {CBR}-based hybrid models of predicting business failure. The need to supplement {CBR} (Case-Based Reasoning) with other classiﬁcation and diagnosis techniques is triggered by the fact that accuracy and effectiveness tend to get reduced when {CBR} alone is applied to handle too many attributes. To enhance the accuracy of bankruptcy prediction, the hybrid models developed by this study include: {RST}–{CBR} (combining Rough Set Theory with {CBR}), {RST}–{GRA}–{CBR} (integrating {RST}, Grey Relational Analysis, and {CBR}), and {CART}–{CBR} (combining Classiﬁcation and Regression Tree with {CBR}). In order to verify the ability of the proposed models to achieve optimal accuracy rate, this study further compares the predictive ability of {CBR} with those of other comparative models.},

In particular, an evaluation model is developed on the basis of accrual ﬁnancial data from 360 Greek municipalities for 2007. A set of customized to the local government context ﬁnancial ratios is deﬁned that rate municipalities and distinguish those with good ﬁnancial condition from those experiencing ﬁnancial problems. The model’s results are analyzed on the 2007 data as well as on a subsample of 100 local governments in 2009. The model succeeded in correctly classifying distressed municipalities according to a benchmark set by the central government in 2010. Such a model and methodology could be particularly useful for performance assessment in the context of several European Union countries that have a similar local government framework to the Greek one and apply accrual accounting techniques.},

	abstract = {More and more models and algorithms are used to predict business failure. Many of them are not suitable for the complicated distribution of ﬁnancial data, which leads to unsatisfactory prediction performance. The manifold learning algorithm is a valid method to preprocess ﬁnancial data because of the good performance on dimensionality reduction for any data distribution. The kernel-based method is introduced to improve the disadvantage of fuzzy self-organizing map ({FSOM}) which is the limitation of spherical data distribution. Therefore, this study adopts manifold learning algorithm to select feature subsets, and employs the kernel-based {FSOM} ({KFSOM}) to compose base classiﬁers, and proposes the two-stage selective ensemble model for business failure prediction ({BFP}). First, three manifold learning algorithms, which are Isomap, Laplacian Eigenmaps and Locally Linear Embedding, are adopted to select three feature subsets from original ﬁnancial data. Then, {KFSOM} uses three kinds of kernel functions respectively, which are Gaussian, Polynomial and Sigmoid, to obtain three classiﬁers. Hence, three feature subsets are computed by {KFSOMs} with three kernel functions respectively to acquire nine base classiﬁers. Last, nine base classiﬁers are integrated by the two-stage selective ensemble method. In the ﬁrst stage, nine base classiﬁers are ranked according to three standards. The stepwise forward selection approach is adopted to selectively integrate nine base classiﬁers according to different standards. In the second stage, three selective ensembles in the ﬁrst stage are integrated again to acquire the ﬁnal result. In the empirical research, this work employs ﬁnancial data from Chinese listed companies to predict business failure, and makes comparative analysis with previous methods. It is the conclusion that the two-stage selective ensemble with manifold learning algorithm and {KFSOM} is good at predicting business failure.},

On a population of Slovenian companies our method achieves remarkable rates of precision in out-ofsample bankruptcy prediction. Our selection method thus represents an efﬁcient way of introducing non-linear effects of predictor variables on the default probability in standard single-index models like logit.

The responses of this mixed model can be ‘estimated’ via conditional hazard function estimation. The random error in this model does not have zero mean and its variance is not constant along the covariate and, consequently, these two quantities have to be estimated. Since the asymptotic expression for the bias is complicated, the two-largebandwidth trick is proposed to estimate the bias. The proposed transformation is very useful for clustered incomplete data subject to left truncation and right censoring (and for complex clustered data in general). Indeed, in this case no standard software is available to ﬁt the frailty model, whereas for the transformed model standard software for mixed models can be used for estimating the unknown parameters in the original frailty model. A small simulation study illustrates the good behavior of the proposed method. This method is applied to a bladder cancer data set.},

However, there are other corruptions in the data that might hinder the prediction performance mainly on the default or bankrupt (positive) cases, where the misclassiﬁcation costs are typically much higher than those associated to the non-default or non-bankrupt (negative) class. Here we characterize the complexity of 14 real-life ﬁnancial databases based on the diﬀerent types of positive samples. The objective is to gain some insight into the potential links between the performance of classiﬁer ensembles ({BAGGING}, {AdaBoost}, random subspace, {DECORATE}, rotation forest, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosting) and the positive sample types.

Further t-statistic and f-statistic are also used separately for feature selection in the ﬁrst phase. In each of these cases, top 10 features are selected and fed to the classiﬁer. Also, the {NN}–{GP} hybrids are compared with {MLFF}, {PNN} and {GP} in their stand-alone mode without feature selection.

Ten-fold cross-validation is performed throughout the study. Results in terms of average accuracy, average sensitivity, average speciﬁcity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) indicate that the {GP} outperformed all the techniques with or without feature selection.

	abstract = {Bankruptcy prediction has been a topic of research for decades, both within the ﬁnancial and the academic world. The implementations of international ﬁnancial and accounting standards, such as Basel {II} and {IFRS}, as well as the recent credit crisis, have accentuated this topic even further. This paper describes both regularized and non-linear kernel variants of traditional discriminant analysis techniques, such as logistic regression, Fisher discriminant analysis ({FDA}) and quadratic discriminant analysis ({QDA}). Next to a systematic description of these variants, we contribute to the literature by introducing kernel {QDA} and providing a comprehensive benchmarking study of these classiﬁcation techniques and their regularized and kernel versions for bankruptcy prediction using 10 real-life data sets. Performance is compared in terms of binary classiﬁcation accuracy, relevant for evaluating yes/no credit decisions and in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy, relevant for pricing differentiated credit granting. The results clearly indicate the signiﬁcant improvement for kernel variants in both percentage correctly classiﬁed ({PCC}) test instances and area under the {ROC} curve ({AUC}), and indicate that bankruptcy problems are weakly non-linear. On average, the best performance is achieved by {LSSVM}, closely followed by kernel quadratic discriminant analysis. Given the high impact of small improvements in performance, we show the relevance and importance of considering kernel techniques within this setting. Further experiments with backwards input selection improve our results even further. Finally, we experimentally investigate the relative ranking of the different categories of variables: liquidity, solvency, proﬁtability and various, and as such provide new insights into the relative importance of these categories for predicting ﬁnancial distress.},

As one of state-of-theart techniques, the bag-of-feature ({BOF}) model has received extensive considerations in characterizing the image. To boost the ﬂexibility during visterm construction in {BOF} model, an integrated scheme for image representation is proposed by adaptive analysis on the local visual complexity of image itself. First, the ﬂatness of each scene category is determined by the total ﬂatness of all images belonging to this category. Then the new integrated image representation of the scene category is built by weighting the two representations (based on a pixels gray value descriptor and a dense {SIFT} descriptor) through the normalized coefﬁcients computed by the ﬂatness of the category. Finally, a hierarchical generative model is exploited to learn natural scene categories. Experimental results demonstrate that the satisfactory classiﬁcation accuracy achieves about 83.67\% on a large set of 15 categories of complex scenes.},

This model improves predictive performance by the combination of multiple classiﬁers and taking advantages of serial combination and parallel combination. Diversity principle and individual optimization principle were taken as criteria for classiﬁer selection. On the foundation of deﬁning selection operator for class’s best classiﬁer, algorithm for constructing basic modules in hybrid combination, dynamic weighting mechanism for parallel modules inside hybrid combination, and mechanism of majority voting were designed. Empirical research with data from Chinese listed companies indicates that the model improves average predictive accuracy and simultaneously reduces variation degree. Statistical analysis demonstrates that the hybrid combination model outperforms existing single classiﬁers in ﬁnancial distress prediction signiﬁcantly.},

	abstract = {Case-based reasoning ({CBR}) was ﬁrstly introduced into the area of business failure prediction ({BFP}) in 1996. The conclusion drawn out in its ﬁrst application in this area is that {CBR} is not more applicable than multiple discriminant analysis ({MDA}) and Logit. On the contrary, there are some arguments which claim that {CBR} with k-nearest neighbor (k-{NN}) as its heart is not surely outranked by those machine learning techniques. In this research, we attempt to investigate whether or not {CBR} is sensitive to the so-called optimal feature subsets in {BFP}, since feature subset is an important factor that accounts for {CBR}’s performance. When {CBR} is used to solve such classiﬁcation problem, the retrieval process of its life-cycle is mainly used. We use the classical Euclidean metric technique to calculate case similarity. Empirical data two years prior to failure are collected from Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China. Four ﬁlters, i.e. {MDA} stepwise method, Logit stepwise method, One-way {ANOVA}, independentsamples t-test, and the wrapper approach of genetic algorithm are employed to generate ﬁve optimal feature subsets after data normalization. Thirty-times hold-out method is used as assessment of predictive performances by combining leave-one-out cross-validation and hold-out method. The two statistical baseline models, i.e. {MDA} and Logit, and the new model of support vector machine are employed as comparative models. Empirical results indicate that {CBR} is truly sensitive to optimal feature subsets with data for medium-term {BFP}. The stepwise method of {MDA}, a ﬁlter approach, is the ﬁrst choice for {CBR} to select optimal feature subsets, followed by the stepwise method of Logit and the wrapper. The two ﬁlter approaches of {ANOVA} and t-test are the fourth choice. If {MDA} stepwise method is employed to select optimal feature subset for the {CBR} system, there are no signiﬁcant difference on predictive performance of medium-term {BFP} between {CBR} and the other three models, i.e. {MDA}, Logit, {SVM}. On the contrary, {CBR} is outperformed by the three models at the signiﬁcant level of 1\%, if {ANOVA} or t-test is used as feature selection method for {CBR}.},

This research is an investigation of the burst of the dotcom bubble from a ﬁnancial perspective. Data from the ﬁnancial statements of several survived and failed dotcom companies is used to compute ﬁnancial ratios, which are analyzed using three classiﬁcation techniques—discriminant analysis, neural networks, and support vector machines to ﬁnd out whether they can predict the ﬁnancial fate of companies. Neural networks perform the task better than other techniques. Using discriminant analysis and neural networks, the key ﬁnancial ratios that play a major role in the process of prediction are identiﬁed. Statistical tests are conducted to validate the ﬁndings.},

Our model consists of a convolutional recurrent neural network which, when concatenated with the numerical ﬁnancial variables, learns a descriptive representation of the text that is suited for corporate distress prediction. We ﬁnd that the unstructured data provides a statistically signiﬁcant enhancement of the distress prediction performance, in particular for large ﬁrms where accurate predictions are of the utmost importance. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that auditors’ reports are more informative than managements’ statements and that a joint model including both managements’ statements and auditors’ reports displays no enhancement relative to a model including only auditors’ reports.

This paper contributes to the current review researches by making a full summary, analysis and evaluation on the current literatures of {FDP}. The current literatures of {FDP} are reviewed from the following four unique aspects: deﬁnition of ﬁnancial distress in the new century, {FDP} modeling, sampling approaches for {FDP}, and featuring approaches for {FDP}. By considering the new state-of-the-art techniques in this area, {FDP} modeling are classiﬁed and reviewed by the following groups: namely, modeling with pure single classiﬁer, modeling with hybrid single classiﬁer, modeling by ensemble techniques, dynamic {FDP} modeling, and modeling with group decision-making techniques. Sampling methods for {FDP} are classiﬁed and reviewed by the following paired groups, namely: training sampling and testing sampling, single industry sampling and cross-industry sampling, balanced sampling and imbalanced sampling. Featuring methods for {FDP} are categorized and reviewed by qualitative selection and combination of qualitative and quantitative selection. We comment on the current researches from the view of each category and propose further research topics. The review paper is valuable to guide research and application of the area.},

	abstract = {In the bid process, predicting whether the contractor will suffer a ﬁnancial crisis during the construction project is vital to project owners and other stakeholders for identifying problems and taking strategic action. In this context, the models for predicting ﬁnancial crisis of contractor have been extensively studied. However, the previous studies have been focused on predicting a ﬁnancial crisis for one-quarter or one-year ahead of prediction point, even though the duration of projects are relatively long in the construction industry, usually exceeding one year. Moreover, despite the possibility of knowing the signs of ﬁnancial crisis of a contractor through predicting ﬁnancial distress, no attempt has been made to predict ﬁnancial distress that contractor can suffer before reaching a ﬁnancial crisis including highly visible legal events, such as bankruptcy, default, and delisting. This means that there is signiﬁcant gap between those models and practical application in terms of the prediction period and deﬁnition of the ﬁnancial crisis. This study proposes voting-based ensemble models that predict ﬁnancial distress of contractor for twoand three-year ahead of prediction point using a ﬁnance-based deﬁnition of ﬁnancial distress. The prediction performance of proposed model was evaluated using ﬁnancial statements of contractors in South Korea from 2007 to 2012. The proposed models showed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) values of 0.940 and 0.910 for predicting ﬁnancial distress for each of the prediction years. By predicting ﬁnancial distress of the contractor from the early stages of a construction project to the end stage with high accuracy, this model can help project owners and broad stakeholders to avoid damage due to ﬁnancial crisis during a project.},

The data, which reveal the true ratio between bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies, are severely imbalanced and only contain a small fraction of bankrupt companies. Our solution to overcome this challenging scenario of imbalanced learning was to adopt three oneclass classiﬁcation methods: a least-squares approach to anomaly detection, an isolation forest, and one-class support vector machines for comparison with conventional support vector machines. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the ﬁnancial attributes and identify those that are most relevant to bankruptcy prediction.

However, the effectiveness of these interventions for ﬁnancial stability has not been extensively researched in the literature. In order to understand the effectiveness of these bailouts for the solvency of banks this paper proposes a new model: the Longitudinal Binary Generalised Extreme Value ({LOBGEV}) model. Differing from the existing models, the {LOBGEV} model allows us to analyse the temporal structure of the probability of failure for banks, for both those that received a bailout and for those that did not. In particular, it encompasses both the ﬂexibility of the D-vine copula and the accuracy of the generalised extreme value model in estimating the probability of bank failure and of banks receiving approval for capital injection. We apply this new model to the {US} banking system from 2008 to 2013 in order to investigate how and to what extent the Troubled Asset Relief Program ({TARP})-Capital Purchase Program ({CPP}) reduced the probability of the failure of commercial banks. We speciﬁcally identify a set of macroeconomic and bank-speciﬁc factors that affect the probability of bank failure for {TARP}-{CCP} recipients and for those that did not receive capital under {TARP}-{CCP}. Our results suggest that {TARP}-{CPP} provided only short-term relief for {US} commercial banks.},

	abstract = {Ratio type ﬁnancial indicators are the most popular explanatory variables in bankruptcy prediction models. These measures often exhibit heavily skewed distribution because of the presence of outliers. In the absence of clear deﬁnition of outliers, ad hoc approaches can be found in the literature for identifying and handling extreme values. However, it is not clear how these diﬀerent approaches can aﬀect the predictive power of models. There seems to be consensus in the literature on the necessity of handling outliers, at the same time, it is not clear how to deﬁne extreme values to be handled in order to maximize the predictive power of models. There are two possible ways to reduce the bias originating from outliers: omission and winsorization. Since the ﬁrst approach has been examined previously in the literature, we turn our attention to the latter. We applied the most popular classiﬁcation methodologies in this ﬁeld: discriminant analysis, logistic regression, decision trees ({CHAID} and {CART}) and neural networks (multilayer perceptron). We assessed the predictive power of models in the framework of tenfold stratiﬁed crossvalidation and area under the {ROC} curve. We analyzed the eﬀect of winsorization at 1, 3 and 5\% and at 2 and 3 standard deviations, furthermore we discretized the range of each variable by the {CHAID} method and used the ordinal measures so obtained instead of the original ﬁnancial ratios. We found that this latter data preprocessing approach is the most eﬀective in the case of our dataset. In order to check the robustness of our results, we carried out the same empirical research on the publicly available Polish bankruptcy dataset from the {UCI} Machine Learning Repository. We obtained very similar results on both datasets, which indicates that the {CHAID}-based categorization of ﬁnancial ratios is an eﬀective way of handling outliers with respect to the predictive performance of bankruptcy prediction models.},
